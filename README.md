# python-workshop

A beginner's python workshop.

This workshop is in multiple parts, which you can do in sequence. The goal is to ensure you have your python development environment set up so you can run python code and know enough to write some basic python programs.

- [Part 1 - Getting your environment setup](part-1-getting-your-environment-setup/README.md)
- [Part 2 - Introduction to Python using The REPL](part-2-introduction-to-python-using-the-repl/README.md)

TODO:

- Part 3 - Building a python program

The plan for part 3:

Build a CLI that calls a web api, processes the data, and prints something.
Look at testing, understanding imports, debugging with the REPL, and other stuff.
Have a challenge in there to complete. Avoid mocks while testing.

- Part 4 - Refactoring

Build on part 3. Refactor the code to be more pythonic, easier to read, etc.
